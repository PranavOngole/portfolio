** Data Analyst @ Capital One** · Austin, TX · US Citizen

I build data systems that scale. SQL, Python, Snowflake, Databricks — I've used them on real problems at real companies processing tens of millions of records daily. I also build things with AI that most data teams haven't figured out yet.

## 🤖 What I'm Building: POV (Pranav Ongole's Vision)

A series of AI-agent-driven data platforms. Each project proves one thesis: **a single AI agent can replace days of manual data engineering work.**

| Project | What It Does | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **[Project-00: US Immigration Data Platform](https://github.com/PranavOngole/Project-00)** | AI agent ingests 27 years of State Dept visa data, cleans 28 inconsistent Excel sheets, loads into DuckDB, and serves an interactive dashboard — autonomously | 🟢 Active |
| **Project-01** | Will be revealed soon | 🔜 Coming |
| **Project-02** | Will be revealed soon | 🔜 Coming |

### What Project-00 proved in one session:
```
✓ Merged 28 Excel sheets (FY1997–2024) with inconsistent column schemas
✓ Standardized 96 visa types across 27 years of naming convention changes
✓ Loaded 5,564 rows × 98 columns into DuckDB
✓ Built interactive Plotly dashboard with filters
✓ Manual estimate: 2 days → Actual: 2 hours

Key insight the agent found: India issued 1.37M visas in FY2024.
150,647 H-1Bs — nearly 5x China's 31,735.
```
