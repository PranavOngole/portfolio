**Data Engineer @ Capital One** · Austin, TX · Building AI agent systems on the side

I spend my days ensuring pricing compliance across 60M+ customer accounts at Capital One — SQL, Python, Snowflake, Databricks, the whole stack. Nights and weekends I'm building something different: **AI agent workflows that automate entire data pipelines from scratch.**

## 🤖 What I'm Building: POV (Pranav Ongole's Vision)

A series of AI-agent-driven data platforms. Each project proves one thesis: **a single AI agent can replace days of manual data engineering work.**

| Project | What It Does | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| **[Project-00: US Immigration Data Platform](https://github.com/PranavOngole/Project-00)** | AI agent ingests 27 years of State Dept visa data, cleans 28 inconsistent Excel sheets, loads into DuckDB, and serves an interactive dashboard — autonomously | 🟢 Active |
| **Project-01** | TBD | 🔜 Coming |
| **Project-02** | TBD | 🔜 Coming |

### What Project-00 proved in one session:
```
✓ Merged 28 Excel sheets (FY1997–2024) with inconsistent column schemas
✓ Standardized 96 visa types across 27 years of naming convention changes  
✓ Loaded 5,564 rows × 98 columns into DuckDB
✓ Built interactive Plotly dashboard with filters
✓ Manual estimate: 2 days → Actual: 2 hours
```

**Key insight the agent found:** India issued 1.37M visas in FY2024. 150,647 H-1Bs — nearly 5x China's 31,735.

## 🧠 The Bigger Picture

```
Today:   1 AI agent → autonomous ETL pipeline
Next:    10 agents working in parallel  
Goal:    LLM Council — Claude + GPT + Gemini — specialized agents, shared mission
```

The immigration platform is the test case. The real product is the agent orchestration system itself.
